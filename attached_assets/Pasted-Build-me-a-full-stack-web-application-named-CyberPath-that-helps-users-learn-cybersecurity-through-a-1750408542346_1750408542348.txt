Build me a full-stack web application named CyberPath that helps users learn cybersecurity through a tailored roadmap and project-based learning. The app should:

🧩 Core Features:
📌 Interactive Roadmap Dashboard

Step-by-step guide covering topics like Recon, Web Hacking, Exploits, AD Attacks, Bluetooth, and CTFs.

Track completion progress with a visual progress bar or badges.

🛠️ Hands-On Project Tracker

Let users log each project (title, description, tools used, result).

Allow uploading scripts, screenshots, or flags.

Each project should be downloadable or shareable.

🧾 Integrated Markdown Blog

Users can write walkthroughs, reports, and thoughts in Markdown.

Preview, edit, and save blog posts.

🚀 GitHub Integration

With user permission, allow uploading:

Notes (.md)

Scripts (.sh, .py, .txt)

Walkthroughs and reports

Authenticate via GitHub and auto-push content to a designated repo.

🧠 AI Assistant Sidebar (Mocked or Integrated)

Teach tips for each topic

Give challenges

Recommend tools

🔐 Secure User Login (Optional)

Use Supabase, Firebase Auth, or a simple JWT system (if needed)

🧰 Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js (with Tailwind CSS or Chakra UI)

Backend: Node.js / Express / Supabase or Firebase

Markdown Editor: Simple React markdown editor

GitHub API for pushes (use Octokit or equivalent)

Persistent local storage for progress

🆓 Deployment:
Ensure the app is deployable freely using Replit's free tier or Vercel/Netlify.

📦 Bonus Ideas (Optional but awesome):
Weekly “quests” or challenges (CTF-style)

Code snippet library with my favorite scripts

JSON export of my training journal

Theme toggles and terminal-style UI

💡 Suggestions from Kali GPT:
Default roadmap can mirror the modules from our hacking-trainer.sh script

The blog section can parse .md exported from your terminal notetaker

Add a page called "Cyber Lab Sync" where you upload your exported ZIP or walkthroughs and the site organizes it visually

Let me know if you’d like me to help design the UI or generate the actual React components or GitHub workflow too!

Would you like me to add:

Firebase or Supabase for authentication/storage?

Real GitHub OAuth push functionality?

A dark/cyberpunk theme?
